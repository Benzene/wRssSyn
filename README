A very simple RSS2/Atom reader.

Reads urls from a feedList.ini file (example one provided).
Can fetch the rss files, parse them, and store the articles in a sqlite database.

In addition, it can parse some specific feeds. Tumblr (dashboard) is supported for now. More coming soon.

A simple viewer (based on the sinatra framework) is included. It provides a minimal application to view the feeds. It can be started via 'ruby viewer/viewer.rb', from the application's main directory.

Run wRssSyn without arguments for a simple help.
